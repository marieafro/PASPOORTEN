                    On October 5, 1938, just before the start of WWII, Germany’s Reich Ministry of the Interior invalidates all passports 
                    held by Jews, became valid only after letter “J” has been stamped. By autumn 1938, all Jewish passports were stamped 
                    with red letter “J” for Jew. Jewish German passports with J are very rare and collectible.</span>  
                <span> "Simultaneous pressure" <br>
                    Figures that are printed in the same place on either side of the page and that overlap or complement each other exactly when the page is held up to the light.
                    The new Swiss passport is a good example of this: the only difference is the black page number at the bottom right.</span>

                <span> "Tuvalu" <br>
                    Tuvalu is one of the world's smallest countries, both in terms of population and land area. According to estimates, 
                    the population of Tuvalu is around 11,500 people. Given the small population size and assuming that most Tuvaluans 
                    hold Tuvaluan passports, it's safe to say that the number of Tuvaluans with passports would be close to the population 
                    figure, likely a few thousand at most. </span>  
                <span> "Ink stamp" <br>

                    The British Indian passport was a passport, proof of national status and travel document issued to the British 
                    subjects of the British Indian Empire, British subjects from other parts of the British Empire, and the subjects 
                    of the British protected states in the Indian subcontinent (i. e. the British Protected Persons of the ‘princely 
                    states’). The title of state used in the passport was the “Indian Empire” which covered Aden, Ceylon, Pakistan, 
                    Bangladesh, Burma, and non French and Portuguese India. The use of the passport was discontinued in Aden and Burma 
                    in 1937, on becoming independent colonies, and in 1948 in the new Dominions of Ceylon, India and Pakistan. In India, 
                    The use of passports was introduced to the British Raj after the First World War. The Indian Passport Act of 1920 
                    required the use of passports, established controls on the foreign travel of Indians, foreigners travelling to and 
                    within the Presidencies and Provinces of British India.</span>

               <span> "Notebook stitch" <br>

            In 1976, Ramesses II (also known as Ramesses the Great, was the third pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt), his remains 
            were issued an Egyptian passport (nearly 3 thousand years after his death) so that he could be transported to Paris for an 
            irradiated treatment to prevent a fungoid growth.</span>
            <span> "Letterpress" <br>
            A printing technique that can be compared to stamping. The pressure with which the ink hits the paper creates greasy, not 
            sharply cut edges on the sides of the image, which is not always clearly visible even with a magnifying glass.</span>

            During the 1990s, North Korea leader Kim Jong-Il, <br> and his son and future leader Kim Jong-Un, used fake Brazilian passports 
            to travel to Disneyland.</span>
            <span> "Sewn on the back" <br>
                In the spine of the passport, the thread with which the passport is bound can be seen in small stitches.</span>

            The Democratic People's Republic of Korea passport, commonly referred to as the North Korean passport, is the passport which may be issued to North Korean citizens for international travel.

                <span> "Contrast strip" <br>
                    To prevent a photo or text from being removed, a foil (plastic layer) is sometimes applied to a page. To hold the foil, the foil is sewn and folded.
                    This creates a narrow 'contrast strip' of the same foil on the other side of the binding.</span>
